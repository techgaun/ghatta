> Helper to use with [generator-nm](https://github.com/sindresorhus/generator-nm) to speed up personal customization

The goal of this script is for me to be able to use same sets of my own configurations and customizations for all my node modules development.

## Install

```shell
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techgaun/ghatta/master/ghatta.sh -O /usr/bin/ghatta && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ghatta
```


## Usage

```shell
$ ghatta
```


## Customization

Update the files in `$HOME/.ghatta/` as per your liking...
Place your own files such as `license` and `.travis.yml` if you wish to add your own customizations on other files
